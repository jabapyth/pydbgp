This is a fork of `ActiveState's PyDBGp server
<http://downloads.activestate.com/Komodo/releases/6.0.0b1/remotedebugging/>`_, which allows one to debug
python programs with a DBGp enabled debugger (for example, `vim-debug
<http://jaredforsyth.com/projects/vim-debug/>`_).

It includes a number for bugfixes to make it more compliant with the `DBGp
specification <http://www.xdebug.org/docs-dbgp.php>`_, and as yet no added features.
